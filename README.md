In this challenge, we’re going to practice performing SQL queries with multiple tables. This should help better solidify some concepts that were covered during lecture.

### Assumptions
--You are using Postico
--Postgres is currently running on your computer

###Setup

Follow the instructions below before continuing with this challenge.

### Create your database, table, and data
We are creating a database with a multiple tables and records. Please follow the instructions below to create a new database with this table and data.

1. Open Postico, if needed
2. Connect to your server, if needed
3. Create a warehouse database
4. In the SQL query window, run the following queries.
5. Click on the OK tab/button to save your database
6. Open the SQL editor and run the following queries

```
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name character varying(60),
    last_name character varying(80)
);

CREATE TABLE addresses (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    street character varying(255),
    city character varying(60),
    state character varying(2),
    zip character varying(12),
    address_type character varying(8),
    customer_id integer REFERENCES customers
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date date,
    total numeric(4,2),
    address_id integer REFERENCES addresses
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    description character varying(255),
    unit_price numeric(3,2)
);

CREATE TABLE line_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    unit_price numeric(3,2),
    quantity integer,
    order_id integer REFERENCES orders,
    product_id integer REFERENCES products
);

CREATE TABLE warehouse (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    warehouse character varying(55),
    fulfillment_days integer
);

CREATE TABLE warehouse_product (
    product_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES products,
    warehouse_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES warehouse,
    on_hand integer,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id, warehouse_id)
);

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
See a diagram of the available entities and their relationships. https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1eA7JJtCVDL0K45aVzbxIUrgWXHoKY5vv1jAhssC2c1A/edit

NOTE: Remember that a many-to-many relationship requires a join table, so the entities in the diagram may be missing some actual tables. Explore the tables in your database.

### GitHub repo

Create a GitHub repo named “prime-group-joins”.
Create a file called “joins-solution.sql”. You will store your responses to the exercise questions here. NOTE: This is merely a text file with a .sql extension.
Exercise
For each of the following questions

Write a comment that specifies which question you are answering. (SQL comments are two dashes, followed by text.)
Write the SQL query that answers the question, below that comment.
Once one person writes half of the queries, switch off.
Example question and answer

```
-- 0. Get all the users
SELECT * FROM customers;
```
### Tasks
1. Get all customers and their addresses.
2. Get all orders and their line items.
3. Which warehouses have cheetos?
4. Which warehouses have diet pepsi?
5. Get the number of orders for each customer. NOTE: It is OK if those without orders are not included in results.
6. How many customers do we have?
7. How many products do we carry?
8. What is the total available on-hand quantity of diet pepsi?
